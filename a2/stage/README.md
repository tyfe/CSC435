This is just a simple grammar for the unnamed language as specified in the CSC435 assignments.
For further information, see the pdf in this directory.

Note that in order to run this project, an out of date version of ANTLR (version 3.0.1) must be set on the class path.

To build the file:

`make`

To clean up the files generated by ANTLR:

`make clean`

To run the tests directly using a shell script, run the `tests.sh` file.

Otherwise, if shell scripts are unavailable for whatever reason (such as on the UVic servers), then run `tests.py` using Python.

The tests script automatically runs `make clean` and `make`, so there's no need to have everything pre-compiled for it. The class path must still be set correctly for it to work however.

If the grammar is working properly, then the tests in the accept folder should all be accepted by the grammar (no output generated by ANTLR). Likewise, any tests in the reject folder should have some sort of output generated by ANTLR stating where the parsing error was.
